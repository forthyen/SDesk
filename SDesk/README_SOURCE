Quick instructions on how to build this. This is pretty involved stuff, so
the expectation is that you are familiar with building software:

1) You need the general Roku development kit.
2) Tweak the Makefiles in SDeskScan and SDesk to point to the correct
   locations.
3) Run make in SDeskScan while on the Roku
4) Run make in SDesk while on the Roku
5) To build a distribution file, run make on a linux box (look for the 
   deploy target to see what get's packaged up).

Have FUN :-)! Anyone is welcome to use this code in any way they wish, as
long as it is lagal. Feel free to continue to develop/maintain it. 
Unfortunately, my Roku burned out, so I have no means to do any additional
support/development anymore.

Notes: As you can see in the Makefiles, there external packages which I am
including in this package (vlc, mxml and id3lib.

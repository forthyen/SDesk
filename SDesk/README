DESCRIPTION
===========
SDesk v0.18
Supported Roku Firmware: 2.0.36 (earlier versions will probably
                                 work, but I haven't tested that).

WARNING! This application is beta. It is provided "As Is", without any
explicit or implied warranty. Any damage caused by it is not my 
responsibility (not that I expect it to cause any damage).

IMPORTANT! When you start the application for the first time, it will
most likely take several minutes (on my system it takes about 6-7
minutes) before the menu shows up. This is due to the fact that the
program will scan through all accessible file systems in an effort
to identify all directories that contain media and also read the tag 
information for music files, and now also video files.


Copyright 2005-2007, by Sven Delmas.

Please give me your feedback via the Roku third party forum. 

If there is anyone out there with some artistic sense, please feel free
to provide me with a better background/layout. Pretty much all locations
for displayed items can be changed through themes/default.theme.


This is a replacement/enhancement for the regular Roku interface. It
provides easy access to all your media and applications. There is
some integration with other third party applications, such as MPlay
and Sonica.

Highlights:
    - Seamless integration of all media types through one UI (pictures,
      music, video, radio).
    - Completely customizable menu structure.
    - Easy favorites/playlist management.
    - Support for RSS feeds.
    - Support for multiple users.
    - Child protection for media content.
    - Shortcut key bindings for often used functions.
    - Support for large size video cover art.
    - Menu item/media types represented with icons.
    - Display arbitrary status information.
    - Automatic initial setup (including scanning for radio stations).
    - Music file tag parsing for tag driven music organization.
    - Completly customizable menu structure. The application will
      perform a scan of your filesystems and generate a menu structure
      based upon that scan. However, feel free to use the various
      configuration files (described below) to customize the 
      interface.


KNOWN ISSUES
============
* The initial menu building may take several minutes (on my system it
  takes about 6-7 minutes). This is due to the fact that it will scan
  through all accessible file systems in an effort to identify all
  directories that contain media and also read the tag information 
  for music files, and now also video files.
* For Revision A Roku boxes, you have to have a swap file enabled. Please
  refer to the relevant Forum article on how to set one up.
* If you have multiple versions of MPlay, do make sure you check that
  you are running the correct one. Look into the file SDesk.cfg and
  search for the mplay entry.
* Except for applications, all commands that are invoked have to be
  shell scripts.
* To run applications, please make sure that execute permission is set.
* I have found that certain radio stations don't work when playing them
  through Sonica. It seems that the codec is crashing due to unsupported
  bit rates. In that case the Roku seems to loose it's SMB shares (I
  assume this is a side-effect of dumping core... I would like to
  understand why that is though). It would be nice if there was a way
  to not crash... not sure what to do abou that...


CHANGES
=======
from 0.1
- Added * for entered password characters
- Renamed vlc to vlc.sdesk to make sure this is the one we find.
- Changed the command invocation to use /bin/sh, so execute permission
  is not an issue. This implies that all internal apps are scripts.
from 0.2
- Added a warning page, and extra sanity checks for the app.
- Changed the output location for the log files to the current directory
  instead the /tmp directory.
- Changed the directory scan root from /mnt/smb to /mnt, so flash cards
  are a also searched.
from 0.3
- Rebuilt for Roku firmware 2.0.24.
from 0.4
- Improved support for DVDs/VOBs.
from 0.5
- Enabled .sdthm files for all item types.
- Added page up and page down capability linked to zoom in and zoom out.
- Improved DVD VOB scanning.
- Added excluded configuration item, to suppress specific directory
  and file names in the browsing windows.
- Added a flat menu mode, where all media type directories are at one
  level.
- Added scanning of radio stations as part of the application.
from 0.6
- Added global "security" and "nosecurity" flags to disable the child
  protection. By default I am now turning off security.
- Added rss feeds.
- Improved DVD support, and also the initial scanning.
- Added resacnning for radio genres.
from 0.7
- Added -noresume to the playmovie script. While that is a personal
  preference, it works better for my primary users (my kids :-).
from 0.8
- Added example SDesk.mnu files to show different toplevel menu
  setups via using the SDesk.cfg option 'menu'.
- Added support for Sonica.
- Artpacks (identified by the .artpack file) are now added to the
  My Slideshows sub menu.
- Supported media types can now be specified via the config file, 
  but default to the ones computed at startup time.
- Items from different drives shoud be sorted correctly in
  flat mode now.
- Added instructions on how to make SDesk the default UI. Use with
  caution.
- Added next song and previous song capability to the fast forward 
  and backward buttons.
- Added support for showing folder.jpg, folder.thm, cover.jpg, cover.thm.
- Added thumbnail display for pictures. Hmmm... by default this
  is disabled because the transformation/rescaling is too slow when 
  browsing. Use the new "showthumb" option to see for yourself :-).
- Added reading of music tags for generating tag based menus.
- Added support for showing embedded cover art from music files.
- Added a nightly run script to perform generic tasks. By default the
  nightly script will sync the time of the roku, and then rebuild
  the menu structure.
- Dropped use of vlc. Radio stations are now played through sonica.
- Added new %showplaylist menu type to display current play list.
- Added status bar to show additional information when actions are
  performed.
from 0.9
- Added vlc back in, for cases where sonica is not there or 
  it doesn't quite work.
- Fixed a bug in the up/down moving for empty folders.
- Fixed a bug in the DVD subdirectory detection. It appears
  that stat is not always working well.
from 0.10
- Fixed a bug in the favorites removal code that crashed the app.
- Included a simple Tcl script to convert .m3u files to .mnu files. This
  is only to show how I do this. The script will need to be adjusted to
  the respective environment, and also requires a Tcl installation.
- Added the ability to remove files from the interface. Add a file
  called sdesk.remove to a foder, and all files in that folder can
  be removed. The actual removal is done by the script apps/removefile, 
  which could be customized if needed. The file removal requires write
  permission on the smb mount. WARNING!!! The file will be gone
  permanently, and without any further warning.
- Set the timer interval to the normal value of 1 hour.
- Implemented a slightly improved look for the UI (still not very
  professional, but I am not an artist).
- Fixed RSS feed parsing (at least for the feeds I know).
- Added a new menu item type url, which I am using to hit urls on my
  local web server to trigger actions. In my case I am controling my 
  x10 devices this way (I have a brief description of my setup below in 
  case anyone is interested).
- Added more theme images, a lot of them came from mythtv themes:
     MythTV itself
     Titivillus: jdonavan@jdonavan.net (http://www.jdonavan.net/myth)
- Added a new option called showlittleicons, which will reenable the
  displaying of the little type icons. This is not set on by default
  because I like the big icons :-).
- Added a new option called justsdthm, which means SDesk just
  looks for .sdthm file for content images. This reduces network
  traffic (but is off by defaul to not upset folks that use .thm and
  related files).
- Added new imagesdir option to specify additional images that
  do not reside in the directory structure. The file name has to 
  match the item name to be found.
from 0.11
- fixed bug in the scheduling of multiple songs (per album)
- added help text for certain items to make clear what <Play> will do.
- fixed aspect ratio for cover art
- added support for http://www.permanence.com/MPlay/infobuilder.aspx to
  get a set of parsable dvd information (thanks to the endless). This
  currently displays the summary underneath the image. Currently the
  .nfo file has to be right where the movie file is (or the directory 
  containing the vob files as folder.nfo). Also added a new submenu 
  item for movies that shows all details. See notes below...
- Investigated support for .jpg for movie cover art... this isn't really
  a good idea, as thos files will show up as regular pictures. Instead
  rename the .jpg files to .thm.
- Added a new SDeskScan.cfg option %dontoverwritevideofavorites, which
  allows the protecting of hand modified Genre specific video favorites. By
  default it is assumed that these are created by scanning the .nfo files.
- Added %compactrootmenu to SDeskScan.cfg, which moves some menu items
  into sub menus to produce a more compact root menu.
- Added %homemanagement to SDeskScan.cfg, which adds a menu item for
  home management (mainly for my own setup).
- Added tmpdir option to SDesk.cfg to specify the location for certain
  temporary files. Usually you don't need to worry about this option.
from 0.12
- Added .ts and .ps as supported video extensions.
- Added a "Rescan videos" menu item to the video menu.
- Added the ability to play all songs in a favorties list by pressing Play
  on the favorite list name.
- Added smallFontSize to the theme options to control text size for
  the summary portion of the movie display, as well as any other
  future areas that need to display high density information.
- Implemented .my scanning.
from 0.13
- Fixed scanning of videos to retain the share names
- Suppressing sequence files that follow the convention of <movie>.002.mpg,
  where we do expect a leading 0.
- Added ability to queue multiple movies for playback
  - Added %playvideoqueue menu entry to play the currently queued movies.
  - Added %clearvideoqueue menu entry to clear the currently queued movies.
- Minor adjustments to the generated menu structure
from 0.14
- Minor bug fixes to file removal
from 0.15
- Reenabled mplay resume
- Fixed file removing
- Fixed sonica locating
- Fixed sonica album playing
from 0.16
- Fixed the slideshow handling. It should now be possible to add
  music and pictures to the slideshow folders (go right on a picure
  or music item and choose "Add to ...". You can create new slideshow
  folders by changing the menu definition (I change the MySlideshows.mnu
  file to add new ones). Choose play in the respective slideshow menu.
from 0.17
- added %dobackup option to SdeskScan.cfg to no longer create .save
  files for newly scanned .mnu files. 
- now statusdailyhour can be set to -1 to disable the daily script.
- changed SDeskScan to not create a fresh SDesk.cfg or sdedkdaily if
  these files already exist (when doing a full scan). So please, if
  you want to have a clean start, remove these files manually.


SETUP
=====
WARNING! This app does require some manual tweaking of configuration 
files to get the most out of it. I am open to suggestions for improving
the initial setup, but it felt like the tweaking is not that hard (well
at least for me ;-), and going much beyond what it does today would
add a lot of work for me (well... and we don't want that... right ;-).

1) Unpack the distribution into a convenient location that is visible 
   from the Roku. Make sure that you can write to that location from
   the Roku box.
2) Make sure that the following external thirdparty applications are
   installed on your Roku before running SDesk for the first time:
    a) MPlay (the main video player).
    b) Sonica (the main music player).
    c) WeatherSix (optional, but very cool).
3) When the program is run for the first time, it will scan your
   currently mounted file systems for applications and media. NOTE: This
   may take several minutes, depending on the size of your file system. It
   will then set up the menu structure accordingly. This scan can be
   done again from the "My Applications/SDesk Setip" menu, but be careful,
   as that will overwrite any manual changes you made in the configuration
   files.
4) After the inital setup you may change the menu files manually. Adding
   new menus, applications, media, favorite locations etc. Please see the
   description of the configuration file formats below.
5) For child protection to work, you need write access to your
   shares.
6) The user switching is done under MyApplications. The default password
   for the super user is "wewe". Passwords are composed of "n", "s", "w"
   and "e" for the directional buttons on your remote, and are specified
   in the respective .mnu file.
7) The themes subdirectory contains a set of default images for the
   user interface. Feel free to change/add the theme files, please share :-).
8) The images directory contains additional images that can be used. Make
   sure the name patches the item you want to represent (up to the last .
   plus the .sdthm extension), and put the image at the same location
   as the item that you wish to represent. For menus, you can put the
   icon where the .mnu file resides.


MAKING SDESK THE MAIN UI
========================
You can make SDesk start automatically when the Roku is booting. I have
not made this a UI level change as manipulating that file is
potentially dangerous and I don't want to mess up peoples systems.

Two solutions:

1) The original Roku UI will be there but if you exit SDesk it is
   immediately restarted. Adjust the path of SDesk to reflect
   the actual location of SDesk on your system. Add the following
   line to /etc/inittab.

::respawn:/mnt/smb/terra/video/SDesk.roku

2) The original will be accessible when you exit SDesk (or if it
   crashes). Copy SDeskRunOnce into /etc and make sure its permissions
   are set to executable with "chmod a+x /etc/SDeskRunOnce". Edit
   SDeskRunOnce to point to the installed SDesk executable. Add the
   following line to /etc/inittab.

::once:/etc/SDeskRunOnce


CREATING A SWAP FILE
====================
I am runnig the following script when the Roku starts. I put the
startswap script into /etc/init.d. Make sure the file has
execute permission, and also adjust the SWAPDIR location to your
respective location. Then create symbolic links to /etc/rc3.d as
such:

ln -s /etc/init.d/startswap /etc/rc3.d/S100startswap
ln -s /etc/init.d/startswap /etc/rc3.d/K10startswap

Making the swap file creation automatic like this is convenient,
but do make sure that you do not remove the flash drive unless you
first call "/etc/init.d/startswap stop".


RUNNING DAILY TASKS
===================
The sdeskdaily script located in the apps directory will be run once
every day after midnight. It used to sync the time and to
rebuild the menus. Feel free to change it any way you want, just
be aware that a rescan of the filesystem will reset it to its original
content. Due to large memory consumption I put a '#' in front of the 
"::respawn:/bin/ntpd -g -n" entry in the /etc/inittab file.


OPERATION
=========
1) Use left, right, up, down and select to choose items. A set of direction
   icons on the left will indicate what arrow keys may be used.
2) The menu button can be used to open sub menus on items (especially
   useful on directory items).
3) The select button will perform the default action for the respective
   item.
4) The play button will play the currently selected item. If the item is
   a directory or play list the respective set of pictures and/or songs
   will be played.
5) The upper right corner shows the current user name.
6) Left from the user name, a key icon is displayed if you are in protected
   mode. This means that specific media may not be played, and that certain
   applications are not available (like rebooting). The child protection
   will create a file named after the media file with an added extension
   of .sdprot.
7) Left from the protected mode icon there are four status lights. It is
   possible to run applications that will return 0 for ok, or 1 for failure,
   which will then affect the color of the status icons. I am using this for
   example to ping my main file server.
8) The rotate button is currently preset with the "stopplay" script, which
   means you can turn off music playback by pressing that button.
9) You can use larger size cover art for videos, and actually any
   item in the system. Just create a png file (maximum size is 300x300)
   at the location of thefile and name it <file>.sdthm. 
10) The pingterra script is an example for a status display script.
11) You can use the zoom in and zoom out buttons to page up and down.
12) By default the setup contains a group of favorites folders for video
    organized by genre. You can add videos to the different lists by
    pressing the right arrow button on the respective item. This will show
    the list of favorites. Select the favorite list to add to and press
    the right arrow again.
13) Support for a daily run script (apps/sdeskdaily) that will rebuild
    the menus and also sync the time (in case ntpd is disabled).
14) Add a file named sdesk.remove to any directory, and you will see
    an additional sub menu item to remove the individual files in that
    directory. 


VIDEO INFO FILES
================
SDesk can read .nfo, .my and .txt files (all following the same format
as seen in the nfo files) to provide movie details. The name of the
.nfo file has to be <BaseName>.nfo (or the other supported extensions),
where <BaseName> is either the name of the mpg file (minus the .mpg) or
the name of a subdirectory containg the vob files. Sorry... I am not
implementing the full blown list of mplay supported file locations for
the lookup, but this is what I am using, and it works well for me :-).

 
CREATING THEME IMAGES
=====================
I am using GIMP, with an added alpha channel. That seems to do the trick,
however I do have to reboot the Roku sometimes between image updates. The
image area can support images up to 300x300 pixels. 


HOME AUTOMATION
===============
The folder home automation contains a number of files that that I am using
to implement home automation at my home. I basically set up my linux box to
be able to issue X10 commands, set up Apache to have some script that do
the operations I want, and added the ability to hit urls from SDesk (the
new %url type).
* menus/HomeManagement.mnu is an example of the url activation
  commands. Add a reference to that menu in your top level menus/SDesk.mnu
  file like this:
    %menu
    apps
    Home Management
    menus/HomeManagement.mnu
    0
* var/www/cgi-bin contains the script that I put into the corresponding 
  Apache cgi-bin directory. Make sure the files are set executable.
* I installed ActiveTcl (http://www.activestate.com), as that version of Tcl 
  has more interesting packages by default. You can probably use the
  standard Tcl that comes with Linux (make sure you change the cgi scripts
  so they can find the Tcl executable.
* I installed x10dev (http://wish.sourceforge.net/index2.html), which will
  generate /dev/x10 (and the relevant device underneath that directory. I
  gave everyone write and execute permission on all the devices in there
  (chmod a+wx /dev/x10/*), so Apache can write to it. I added that in the
  /etc/init.d/x10.plusb script.
* I included a script called x10schedule.tcl (and the associated file 
  commands.tcl) in the var/www/cgi-bin directory. I run that on my server
  to have repeated tasks happen. This is just a starting point, so whoever
  feels like spending more time on this, feel free to do so. 


TODO
====
Next release:

More long term:
* Testing on different resolutions. If somebody has a free big screen/hdtv
  for me, I am gladly going to test on that too ;-).
* Support chapter selection on movies (if mplay would allow for specifiying
  that on the command line... probably not any time soon :-).


CONFIGURATION FILE FORMATS

called sdeskscanlog.

now off to prevent filesystem overflow.

useful when you tend to modify the favorites by hand. I have them created
automatically based upon the .nfo files, which seems to be the easier way.
